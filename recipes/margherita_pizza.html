    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 (14-1/2 ounce can) whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divied</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
        <li>6 ounces fresh mozarella cheese, chopped</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>10 leaf basil leaves, torn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
            Spread each sheet of puff pastry onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper. 
            Use a rolling pin to roll pastry into even rectangles. Lift pastry (with parchment paper) onto baking sheets. </li>
        
        
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        
        <li>Pierce puff pastry all over with a fork. 
            Beat egg with water in a small dish; brush pastry all over with egg wash. </li>

        
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. </li>


        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>

        <li>Meanwhile, pulse tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil, garlic, and a pinch of salt together in a food processor until pureed. </li>


        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>

        <li>Carefully press pastry crusts down to deflate them. 
            Spread half the tomato sauce evenly to within about an inch of edges of each crust; drizzle with remaining olive oil. 
            Top evenly with mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>


        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>

        <li>Bake until cheese is melted and crust edges are golden, about 5 minutes more. 
            Remove from the oven and scatter basil leaves over the top. Slice and serve hot.</li>


    </ul>
